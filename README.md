# server-terraformer
The main goal of this project is that in case of my homlab server failure, I want to be able to clone the full service enverinment as easily as possible.

This repo is mainly to give you an idea to how can you build a terraformer like this. My guess is that you probaly wont need the exact same services as I, so go ahead and modify it.
